I am a PhD student in Computational Biology at the University of Maryland, College Park under the supervision of Dr. Rob Patro. I received my B.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Kashan University, Iran; and my M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology (SUT), Iran. I love programming and also working in bio-related fields, and computational biology was the field where these two merge together. I am currently working on two projects under the supervision Dr. Rob Patro in the COMBINE-Lab group.  The first project focuses on deriving better estimates of quantification uncertainty in complex scenarios by improving the bootstrapping procedure used for posterior uncertainty estimation. Second, I am working on developing improved long-read quantification models (ONT and PacBio) compatible with Salmon. My research interests are utilizing statistical models in gene expression analysis and detecting differential alternative splicing events as well as applying deep learning in single cell data analysis.

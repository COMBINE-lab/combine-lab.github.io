I'm a PhD student working with Dr. Rob Patro at the Dept. of CS in UMD. My research interests are principally focused in algorithmic genomics â€” especially in designing efficient data structures and algorithms for high-throughput genomic data and complete genome references. My current research pertains to efficient representation methods for reference- and read-based de Bruijn graphs.

Broadly, my interests lie in Theory and Algorithms, along with Artificial Intelligence. Visit my website for further information!

I am a PhD student concentrated in Computational Biology in [BISI](https://www.bisi.umd.edu/) at UMD. I received my B.S. degree in Biotechnology from Huaqiao University, and completed my M.S. in Systems Biology and Bioinformatics at Case Western Reserve University.  

I joined in COMBINE lab in May 2020. Under the direction of professor Rob Patro, I am currently working on methods for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data. My research interests include but are not limit to applying deep learning architectures in scRNA-seq data analysis, and utilizing graph-based algorithms in gene expression analysis. As a student with biology background, I aim to develop biologist-friendly tools that can help biologists to solve tough and complex research questions.

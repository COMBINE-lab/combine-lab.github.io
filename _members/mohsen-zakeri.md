I am currently a PhD student in the Computer Science department at the University of Maryland. I am proud to be a member of COMBINE-lab since 2016 working with an amazing group. I am mostly interested in working on problems related to sequence indexing, alignment, and quantification.

I did my undergrad at the University of Tehran, studying Computer Engineering majoring in Software Engineering. In 2015, I joined the PhD program at the Stony Brook University intending to work on Bioinformatics since I was already fascinated about Biology and Algorithm Design.

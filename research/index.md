Even with this excellent website template, this is the most difficult section of the website to create initially.  It requires 
extracting our publications into **yet another format**.  While we work on creating this part of the website so that we have 
a unified list of publications on the web that is (hopefully) easy to maintain --- you might find an unofficial list on 
[Rob's Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H36hOqEAAAAJ&hl=en).

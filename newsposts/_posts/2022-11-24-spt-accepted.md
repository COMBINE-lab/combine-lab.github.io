Our paper on spectrum preserving tilings (SPTs), led by [Jason Fan](https://www.jason-fan.com/), and in collaboration with [Jamshed Khan](https://sites.google.com/view/jamshed/?pli=1) and

preprint [here on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.27.513881v1).  Also, you can check out the current source code (though it's still heavily

Zhezhen Wang is a PhD student working in the COMBINE lab. Her interests center around spatial transcriptomics data, and specifically 
single-cell spatial transcriptomics data.  She is interested in developing novel methods for representing, compressing, transferring and 
processing this increasingly prevalant modality of data.

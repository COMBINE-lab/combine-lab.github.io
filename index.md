The COMBINE lab was created in the fall of 2014, when [Rob Patro](http://www.robpatro.com) joined the Computer Science Department at Stony Brook University.  The lab has since grown considerably.  Learn more about us below!

### Research Interests

The research interests of our lab broadly span many areas of computational biology and bioinformatics.  Some of our main areas of interest include:

  * Algorithms for high-throughput transcriptomics (RNA-seq)
    * assembly, quantification, *de novo* analysis, differential expression
  * Biological network analysis 
    * how networks evolve over time, ancestral network inference, network alignment
  * Chromatin structure and epigenetic regulation
    * long-range regulation, structure / function relationship, analysis of Hi-C data
  * Data representation and storage
    * read compression, dynamic text indexing, direct query of compressed representations
